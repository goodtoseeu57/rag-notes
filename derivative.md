$$ f'(a) = \lim\_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $$

This limit represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function $f$ with respect to $x$ at the point $a$. It can also be interpreted as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $y=f(x)$ at $x=a$.

Alternatively, the definition can be expressed as:

$$ f'(a) = \lim\_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} $$

Both definitions are equivalent. The function $f'(x)$ (read as "f prime of x"), which gives the derivative at any point $x$ where the limit exists, is called the derivative function or simply the derivative of $f$.
